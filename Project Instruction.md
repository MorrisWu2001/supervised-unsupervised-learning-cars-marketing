This project applies both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to two real-world marketing and pricing problems using observational data. The goal is to demonstrate how different machine learning paradigms can be used to extract actionable insights from structured datasets, while emphasizing reproducibility, interpretability, and out-of-sample evaluation.

The first part of the project focuses on supervised learning using the cars_big.csv dataset. The objective is to build a predictive model that estimates vehicle prices based on observable features and characteristics. A step-by-step modeling workflow is followed, including data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation. Model performance is assessed using out-of-sample prediction errors to understand how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

The second part of the project addresses unsupervised learning through a market segmentation analysis using the social_marketing.csv dataset. This dataset contains Twitter activity from followers of a large consumer brand, where each user is represented by the number of posts they made across a predefined set of interest categories. Because no labeled outcomes are provided, unsupervised techniques are used to uncover latent structure in the data. The analysis explores audience segmentation through patterns of shared interests, identifying distinct groups within the brand’s social-media audience.

Throughout the project, careful attention is given to data preprocessing, methodological justification, and the interpretation of results in a business context. All analyses are conducted in R and documented using R Markdown, ensuring full reproducibility with integrated code, visualizations, and narrative explanations. The final output is a cohesive report designed to support data-driven decision-making for pricing strategy and audience targeting.
